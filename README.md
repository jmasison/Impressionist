# Impressionist



You must implement three brush types where a brush type is defined by having a certain shape (circles, triangles, squares) and/or behavior (paint splatter). At least one brush type must change it's behavior based on the motion of the user's finger (e.g., the brush size is dynamically set by the velocity of the finger or the brush direction is orthogonal to the user's motion). The user should be able to dynamically select the brush types and use multiple brushes on the same painting. To help inspire you to think of brush types, here are the Google Images "Impressionist Art" results.

You must implement a load image feature. This is already done in the initial project code I provided.
You must implement a save feature. The saved file should be automatically added to the Android photo gallery.
You must implement a clear feature that clears the painting but keeps the loaded image.
You must implement one bonus feature that is distinct from IA07. So, for example, if you implemented undo/redo in IA07, you cannot use this as your bonus feature in IA08 (though you can certainly program this functionality).
