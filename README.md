# Impressionist

The Impressionist Application is an application that allows a user to load an image into the application and then create abstract/impressionist art using that image as a base. There are three brush types implemented where a brush type is defined by having a certain shape (circles, lines, squares). Each of the brushes changes it's behavior based on the motion of the user's finger (the brush size is dynamically set by the velocity of the finger). The user is able to dynamically select the brush types and use multiple brushes on the same painting. Aditional features incllud a save feature (the saved file should be automatically added to the Android photo gallery) a clear feature (that clears the painting but keeps the loaded image) and a bonus splat feature (which adds random splats of the type that the user selects, when used enough it will in a sense autodraw).
